Using the Django web framework, this project models a tool rental website, using an SQLite database to manage the available inventory. A user is able to rent a tool and the database will update accordingly. The website will not focus on returns, replacements, or managing revenue history, only renting items and updating the inventory. This project reuses the majority of my existing code from the dynamic tool rental website I made (the main theme, the tools page, the pricing page, and the terms and conditions page). It was easier to take the code I already had and put it in Djangoâ€™s templates than to write completely new templates from scratch.
